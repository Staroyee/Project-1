# Project-Movie-Multiverse

## Description
As a team, we were tasked to conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

## Solve
The completion of this project provides the user with a functional movie search app, which displays movie details from the TMDB API and a review from the New York Times API.
The movie can be saved in the favourites seciton and be called upon later to re-display the movies details and review.

The webpage is now deployed for use.

## We have learned:
* How to learn to use a new CSS framework
* How to use the CSS framework called 'Skeleton'
* How to find new server-side APIs to use.
* How to read the technical documentation of server-side APIs
* How to use JavaScript to call upon server-side-APIs.
* How to use JavaScript to access the data within the APIs.
* How to use JavaScript to display the data on the webpage.

4. Use the git command `git clone` followed by the URL copied from Github to clone the repo to our machine.
5. The `git clone` command creates a new directory with the same name as the repository. We navigate into our new directory using `cd`.
6. The repository should now be cloned onto your device and able to be edited in VScode or another editing software.
